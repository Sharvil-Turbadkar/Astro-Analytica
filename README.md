## Forecasting outcomes and election polls using twitter sentimental analysis

We have collected our data using twitter premium functionalities 

API calls are made using tweepy and the data which has been collected through this API is stored in an S3 bucket. 

We then use IAM roles for de-coupling the front end of the application(made using flask) from the back end(data being fetched from S3 bucket)
